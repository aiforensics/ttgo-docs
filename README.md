## Technical Overview

The `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` package extends the Docusaurus CLI with commands for generating MDX using the OpenAPI specification as the source. The resulting MDX is fully compatible with [plugin-content-docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs) and can be used to render beautiful reference API docs by setting `docItemComponent` to `@theme/ApiItem`, a custom component included in the `docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs` theme.

Key Features:

- **Compatible:** Works with Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.
- **Fast:** Convert large OpenAPI specs into MDX docs in seconds. ðŸ”¥
- **Stylish:** Based on the same [Infima styling framework](https://infima.dev/) that powers the Docusaurus UI.
- **Capable:** Supports single, multi and _even micro_ OpenAPI specs.
